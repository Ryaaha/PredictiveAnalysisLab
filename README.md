# Predictive Analysis Lab
5 projects for Lab Work


## 1. Time Series Forecasting
Comparative Analysis on Stock Price prediction of Retail Store Companies using traditional time series and machine learning models suited for seasonal trends: SARIMA, ARFIMA, Exponential Smoothing(Holt - Winters), Prophet, LSTM.

## 2. Predicting Solar Flares
Accurately predicting solar flares using LSTM and Prophet. While Prophet is mainly a business oriented model, using its strong seasonal trend analysis capabilities can help find patterns in solar flares.

## 3. Traffic Congestion Prediction
Predicting when and where increased chances of traffic congestion might be seen in city. 

## 4. Prediction of Rocket Launch Delays
Predicting if weather conditions will be safe for a rocket launch. NASA's annotated safest atmospheric conditions will be used as a guideline. 

## 5. Utilising GARCH to incorporate volatility in Time Series Forecasting
Modelling the mean with the best outcome model from project 1, and then using GARCH to model the volatility and combining the two to produce a more optimized output.
